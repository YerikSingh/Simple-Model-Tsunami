# Simple-Model-Tsunami
In this paper, we discuss and analyse a simple Tsunami model. The Finite
Difference Method is used to solve the two dimensional wave equation with
constant velocity. Adapting the same method, the wave equation is then
solved for a variable velocity, which is the Tsunami wave model we study. The
displacement of the wave is plotted against the surface at different time instants
and a physical interpretation of the results is done. Further, the amplitude of
the wave at one point of the grid (constant x and y index) is plotted against
time index to further analyze the nature of the wave model. The paper then
goes on to discuss the further scope of this research and possible outcomes of
more appropriate models.
